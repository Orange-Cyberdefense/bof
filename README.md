BOF 
===

BOF (Boiboite Opener Framework) is a testing framework for field protocols
implementations and devices. It is a Python 3.6+ library that provides means to
send, receive, create, parse and manipulate frames from supported protocols.

The library currently supports **KNXnet/IP**, which is our focus, but it can be
extended to other types of BMS or industrial network protocols.

There are three ways to use BOF:

* Automated: Use of higher-level interaction functions to discover devices and
  start basic exchanges, without requiring to know anything about the protocol.

* Standard: Perform more advanced (legitimate) operations. This requires the end
  user to know how the protocol works (how to establish connections, what kind
  of messages to send).

* Playful: Modify every single part of exchanged frames and misuse the protocol
  instead of using it (we fuzz devices with it). The end user should have
  started digging into the protocol's specifications.

**Please note that targeting industrial systems can have a severe impact on
buildings and people and that BOF must be used carefully.**

Getting started
---------------

```
git clone https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/bof.git
```

Requirements (Protocol implementations use
[Scapy](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)'s format): ``` pip install
scapy ```

BOF is a Python 3.6+ library that should be imported in scripts.  It has no
installer yet so you need to refer to the `bof` subdirectory which contains the
library (inside the repository) in your project or to copy the folder to your
project's folder. Then, inside your code (or interactively), you can import the
library:

```python
import bof
```

Now you can start using BOF!

TL;DR
-----

### Discover devices on a network

```python
from bof.layers.knx import search

devices = search()
for device in devices:
    print(device)
```

Should output something like:

```
Device: "boiboite" @ 192.168.1.242:3671 - KNX address: 15.15.255 - Hardware: 00:00:ff:ff:ff:ff (SN: 0123456789)
```

### Send and receive packets

```python
from bof.layers.knx import KNXnet, KNXPacket, SID
from bof import BOFNetworkError

try:
    knxnet = KNXnet().connect("192.168.1.242", 3671)
    pkt = KNXPacket(type=SID.description_request,
                    ip_address=knxnet.source_address,
                    port=knxnet.source_port)
    pkt.show2()
    response, _ = knxnet.sr(pkt)
    response.show2()
except BOFNetworkError as bne:
    pass
finally:
    knxnet.disconnect()
```

### Craft your own packets

```python
from bof.layers.knx import KNXPacket, SID
from bof.layers.raw_scapy.knx import LcEMI

pkt = KNXPacket(type=SID.description_request)
pkt.ip_address = b"\x01\x01"
pkt.port = 99999 # Yes it's too large
pkt.append(LcEMI())
pkt.show2() # This may output something strange
```

> A recipient device will probably not respond to that, but at least you know
  that BOF won't stop you from messing with your packets.

### Interface with Scapy

BOF relies on Scapy for protocol implementations, with an additional layer that
translates BOF code to changes on Scapy packets and fields. Why? Because BOF may
slightly modify or override Scapyâ€™s internal behavior.

You do not need to know how to use Scapy to use BOF, however if you do, you are
free to interact with the Scapy packet directly as well.

```python
packet = KNXPacket(type=connect_request)
packet.field1 = 1 # Applying additional BOF operations (ex: change types)
packet.scapy_pkt.field1 = 1 # Direct access to Scapy Packet object
```

Contributing
------------

Contributors are welcome! BOF is still an ongoing project, which relies on
industrial network protocol implementations in Scapy format. You can first
contribute by contributing to Scapy and adding new protocols ("layers"). Or, you
can contribute by integrating a Scapy protocol to BOF. The documentation
explains how to do it. Furthermore, there will still be room for higher-level
functions that will make tests easier or implement known attack against
protocols or protocol implementations.

Here a few things to know beforehand:

* We like clean code and expect contributions to be PEP-8 compliant as much as
  possible (even though we don't test for it). New code should be readable
  easily and maintainable. And remember: if you need to use "and" while
  explaining what your function does, then you can probably split it.

* Please write Unit tests and make sure existing ones still pass! They are in
  `tests/`. You can run all unit tests with: `python -m unittest discover -s
  tests`
